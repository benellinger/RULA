 This is an automatic implementation of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment by using data from IMU sensors from Noraxon. 

Run `python app-dev.py` to start the App. The App currently runs in Terminal Mode only. In folder dist is an .msi-Installer for Windows.
In a future version is a GUI or WebApp planned that imports the data via http-streaming in Real Time.
